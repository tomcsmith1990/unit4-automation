# unit4-automation

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/tomcsmith1990/unit4-automation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomcsmith1990/unit4-automation)

This provides automation for [Unit4's Business World On!](https://www.unit4.com/uki/applications/erp/business-world) (formerly known as Agresso).

It makes SOAP requests using Unit4's _Resql_ langauge. It pulls together many of these requests to form an overall BCR, which it then writes to Excel.

It uses the [commandlineparser](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline/wiki) library.
